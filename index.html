    <section>
        <b>Psalm 23:1</b><br><br>
         The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want. he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

     <b>The commentaries</b><br> 
     <p>
        What condescension is this, that the infinite Lord assumes towards his people the office and character of a Shepherd! It should be the subject of grateful admiration that the great God allows himself to be compared to anything which will set forth his great love and care for his own people. David had himself been a belong to the Lord.

        <b>Matthew 7:1-3</b><br><br>
        Judge not, that ye be not judged. ²For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. ³And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

     <p>
        Christ does not say "never judge," He warns that there is a consequence to judgment. Second, this statement is immediately followed by instructions from Christ on the proper way to use judgment. Third, Jesus' other teachings explicitly indicate that right judgment is necessary (John 7:24), while hypocritical or shallow judgment is wrong.

    <section>
     <b>Psalm 24:2</b><br><br>
      For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.3Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place?
    </section><br>
        <b>The Commentaries</b><br>
        <p>
            It is God who lifts up the earth from out of the sea, so that the dry land, which otherwise might in a moment be submerged, as in the days of Noah, is kept from the floods. The hungry jaws of ocean would devour the dry land if a constant fiat of Omnipotence did not protect it.
        </p>

    <section>
        <b>Genesis 1:9</b><br><br>
        And God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear." And it was so.
    </section><br>
        <b>The Commentaries</b>
        <p>It is that grand act whereby Almighty God in the beginning called into being the finite world. Secondary creation, on the other hand, belongs to the sphere of Providence, or to the sphere of the history of the finite world.</p>

    <section>
        <b> James 1:9</b><br><br>
        Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry, because angry does not produces any good
    </section><br>
        <b>The Commentaries</b>
            <p> James was talking about anger as an instrument to destruction, it only takes a virtual to be of no anger issues but in all situations we all tend to be calm</p>
            <section>
       <b>MATTHEW 5: 19-20</b></br><br>
       least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of. Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them. shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
     </section><br>
     <b>The Commentaries</b>
     <p>
        Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
